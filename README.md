# TypeScript Examples

Here you can find my source code for TypeScript "advanced" type examples

You can simply open the root folder in your IDE or VS Code.

For each step/example there are two folders: the one without `x_` in its name and the one with an `x_` in its name:

* Without `x_` is excercise/live-coding starting point
* With `x_` is complete solution
* Inside the solutions there are also links to TypeScript documentation.

To make the [https://github.com/colinhacks/zod](Zod) example work, you have to run `npm install` or `yarn install` before.

Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
